# Goxygen

## Environment setup

You need to have [Go](https://golang.org/),
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/),
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/), and
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
(comes pre-installed with Docker on Mac and Windows)
installed on your computer.

Verify the tools by running the following commands:

```sh
go version
npm --version
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```

If you are using Windows you will also need
[gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/). It comes installed
on Mac and almost all Linux distributions.
